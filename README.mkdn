### First things first ###
~ There will be NO SHARING OF BUILDS ON XDA...Cant have nothing nice...THIS IS FINAL** ~

**Getting Started**

To get started with BrokenRoms, you'll need to get familiar with Git and Repo.

**To initialize your local repository using the AOSP/CAF based BrokenRoms source, use this command:**

repo init -u git://github.com/BrokenROM/platform_manifest.git -b m6.0.1

**Sync up with this command:**

repo sync -f -jX (-f being for force and replace the X in -jX with the number of cpus/threads your box contains (WARNING: Going too high can severely drag performance)

**Initiate the build with:**

. build/envsetup.sh

**Prepare your device with:**

lunch (pick your devices number from the list)

**Then fire it off with:**
first make yourself an official Broken Rom builder, type:
    export FUCK_XDA=true 
then     
    time make broken -jX 

(x being the amount of cores/threads your build box contains...Adjust accordingly, but going too high for your box can cause complications..Be warned)

**Alternatively you can use our custom build script that will handle everything for you when building official devices by using the format:**

./build-broken.sh (flags) (device)

Example flags can be seen by issuing -h as a flag
